# Key Concepts

- **LLM Exports** ensure documentation can be ingested quickly.
- **copyOrDownloadAsMarkdownButtons** can be registered globally but aren't necessary for this fixture.
- Use `<llm-only>` and `<llm-exclude>` to fine-tune content.

<llm-only>
Included in LLM exports.
</llm-only>

<llm-exclude>
Excluded from LLM exports.
</llm-exclude>
