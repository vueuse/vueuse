# Getting Started

The fixture keeps things intentionally simple:

1. Use `pnpm vitepress dev test/fixtures/llms-docs` to preview the site.
2. The vitepress-plugin-llms integration should emit `llms.txt` and `llms-full.txt` in the dist folder.
3. Each page bundles a Markdown-friendly copy for LLMs.
